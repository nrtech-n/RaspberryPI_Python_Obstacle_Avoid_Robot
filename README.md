## GoPiGo Robot - Obstable Avoider

### This project uses the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor to build an obstacle avoidance robot. 

* Combined with the other Browser Streaming Robot project you can pretty much monitor the movements of the robot around the place. 

**Usage:**

* Open LXTerminal in VNC or Pi Desktop or just SSH into the Pi
* Go to the folder where you've downloaded the code:

`bash# cd Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/Basic_Robot_Control/GUI`

* Run the example:

`bash# python ./basic_obstacle_avoidv0.006.py`
